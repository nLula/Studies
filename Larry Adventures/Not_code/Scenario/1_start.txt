You wake up in dark room, tied to a bed you lay on. 
Only single sunbeam is breaking through wooden shutters on the window, instantly you notice 
they aren't tightly closed, maybe there is a chance...


...Your memory starts slowly returning and you remember what brought you here.
Falling in love with that queen Alliyah, fourth wife of king Cuckhold wasn't the best idea.
Guards caught you in the very moment of intimacy and you accidently 
spitted the love juice in that scary scarface of Muhammad-The-Bonecrusher. 
Ruined such an ending, boner crusher indeed..


Well, anyways now it is time to to save yourself from this situation or for sure 
His Majesty will start the exectuion from cutting the other head.
That single sunbeam you noticed before is a sign of starting morning, 
and soon town square will be full of people awaiting for a show, so time is short!

You feel like you wan't to start [screaming] for help, maybe someone will save you?
You try to move and understand that one of your hands is slightly loose, 
and there is a rusty nail on a side of this old bed, also a small table 
full of torturing tools is nearby and maybe it is possible to reach them with your hand, 
but the time is running out and you need to start acting fast. What should you choose, 
try to [cut the ropes] with rusty nail, or [try to reach] out 
for a sharp tool and cut the ropes with some of them?
