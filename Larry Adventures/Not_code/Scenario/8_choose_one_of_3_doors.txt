Dark corridor is empty and only few torches are bringing some poor light in here.
You see only three different doors, and none of it has an "exit" sign...

So you decide to open them one by one, hoping that there is nobody behind any 
of them and you find a way out.

Which door should you try first?
- [1st door] made of wood and you feel bad smell behind it.
- [2nd door] also wooden, looks like it was closed for years.
- [3rd door] covered in metal, has some kind of code locking.
