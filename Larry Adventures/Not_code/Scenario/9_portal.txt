You enter a small room with cylinder of blue light, 
sparks flying all over it..Beautiful and scary.
Suddenly you hear stomps of guards. You peek into hallway and see them raged
and running towards you.
	There is nothing else to do, but step inside it hoping this portal looking
light won't dissolve you. 
You step in..
