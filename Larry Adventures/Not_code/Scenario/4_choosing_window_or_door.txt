At least! Almost broke an arm trying to grab those bloody 
(well, they are actually bloody!) tools, but in the end you got a knife-shaped 
something which is really helpful and eventhough it is not easy you make it, 
you the ropes on your right hand! 

Now it's time to set free another one and get rid of ones that are holding your legs. 
Finally! Free as a bird! Oh... But still inprisoned. You remove shutters from window 
and see that they are open! Foolish guards though you will never cut ropes and didn't 
believed you will [escape through window], haha! 

Ooooops! It is really high up here, falling down will just ease the executioners job, 
maybe try to [open a door]...
