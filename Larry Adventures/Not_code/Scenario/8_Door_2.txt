You try to psuh old wooden door, it moves a bit, so you try it harder. Damn!
It stuck! Or stop, maybe pulling it will do the job..
You pull door wide open and stare eye-in-eye with white rabbit sitting all alone 
in the dark room. Crap. Who would of put a rabbit to an empty room?

Rabbit seems not moving at all, not even blinking...You try to touch him and he crumbles
into ashesh falling on the floor.

You investigate the room trying to find any clues why should anyone do this kind
of wizardy.. Ash from disappeared rabbit is starting to move on the floor forming 
some kind of text. THOSE ARE NUMBERS! 

ASHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHFIVETHREEFOURONESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...

...And wind (where the damned devil would of take WIND on ONE SMALL EPMTY ROOM?) washes
all of the ash away..
