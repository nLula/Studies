You made it in time! Seems like trying to open a door caught guards attention and 
you escaped in very last moment. Guards started shouting and screaming.. 

You start slowly moving on the edge of a small balcony towards a nearby window.
Wow! It's pretty high up here, no wonder the window was opened.
People on the town square seem to be like little chaoticly moving dots.
Meanwhile wind blows hard up here and makes you stagger.
Your head starts going dizzy, you get scared, but step by step you move to the 
window nearby hoping it is not closed and there is nobody inside.

Finally you reach the window! And it's open! It looks like every God you heard of
is helping you out right now.

So you get in the room and discover yourself in a mansionlike room. All is covered
with gold and velvet, it looks like some rich guy is owning this suite.
Bet he is running now all over the castle searching you, hehe.

But no time to think about it, need to get out of here, better [check] what
is happening behind the door, or should you [wait] a little ?
